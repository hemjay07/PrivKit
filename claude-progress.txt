# PrivKit - Claude Progress Report

## Operational Notes
- **Start CLI development**: `npm install --prefix packages/cli && npm run build --prefix packages/cli`
- **Test CLI generation**: `node packages/cli/bin/create-solana-privacy-app.js my-project -t privacy-cash --helius-key testkey --skip-install --skip-git -y`
- **Start landing page**: `npm install --prefix apps/web && npm run dev --prefix apps/web` (runs on port 3000+)
- **All 4 templates available**: privacy-cash, light-protocol, arcium, full-stack
- **GOTCHA**: `.env.example` uses placeholder `YOUR_HELIUS_API_KEY`, `.env.local` gets actual key
- **GOTCHA**: Helius API key uses password prompt with masking (`mask: '*'`) in interactive mode
- **GOTCHA**: Landing page may use different port if 3000 is busy (check console output)
- **GOTCHA**: privacy-cash template requires Node 24+ (CLI now shows warning if using older version)
- **Spec reference**: `/Users/mujeeb/Downloads/PRIVKIT_COMPLETE_SPEC_V3.md`

3. Implement the CLI core code in `packages/cli/src/`
4. Create template files in `packages/cli/templates/`
5. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to verify
6. Mark features as passing when tests pass

## Key Implementation Areas
1. **CLI Core** - `packages/cli/src/index.ts`, `generator.ts`, `templates.ts`
2. **CLI Utils** - `packages/cli/src/utils/` (logger, validation, fs)
3. **Templates** - `packages/cli/templates/{privacy-cash,light-protocol,arcium,full-stack}/`
4. **Landing Page** - Already scaffolded, needs refinement

## Commands to Continue Development
```bash
# Setup development environment
./init.sh

# Or manually:
cd packages/cli && npm install && npm run build
cd apps/web && npm install && npm run dev

# Link CLI for local testing
cd packages/cli && npm link
create-solana-privacy-app test-project
```

## Implementation Progress
- Feature #1 (Helius API key masked in prompts): PASSING
- CLI Core implementation completed
- Privacy-cash template structure completed
- Total progress: 1/290 (0.3%)

## Session 1 Implementation Details
Added the following to CLI:
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts` - Main entry with Commander + Inquirer
- `packages/cli/src/generator.ts` - Project scaffolding logic
- `packages/cli/src/templates.ts` - Template registry
- `packages/cli/src/utils/logger.ts` - Chalk + ora utilities
- `packages/cli/src/utils/validation.ts` - zod + npm name validation
- `packages/cli/src/utils/fs.ts` - File system helpers
- `packages/cli/src/utils/package-manager.ts` - npm/yarn/pnpm detection
- `packages/cli/bin/create-solana-privacy-app.js` - CLI entry point

Added privacy-cash template:
- `packages/cli/templates/privacy-cash/template.json`
- `packages/cli/templates/privacy-cash/files/` - All template files

## Notes
- The complete implementation spec is at: `/Users/mujeeb/Downloads/PRIVKIT_COMPLETE_SPEC_V3.md`
- Use YOLO mode for CLI development (no browser testing needed)
- Use standard mode for landing page (needs visual verification)
- Privacy Cash template requires Node 24+

## Remaining Work
1. Implement remaining 3 templates (light-protocol, arcium, full-stack)
2. Add CLI tests
3. Refine landing page components
4. Complete CI/CD workflows
5. Add documentation files (CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE)
